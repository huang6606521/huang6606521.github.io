DFS is a duty free shopping mall which locates in Waikiki.  As a demonstrator, demonstrating products that tell customers what the ingrediant is and how to use it is my main job.  It looks like a simple job but memorizing all products is also a challenging when people ask me about them.  Meanwhile, I help customers to translate when they are asking questions.
