## Javascript Reflection

Unlike C language or C++ language, Javascript does not have complicated pointers work needed which is much easier to be understood and accepted. Also, Javascript which relates to website designing is the majority choice for website designers.  I have experienced C, C++ and Java for two years so as my perspectives Javascript is more dynamic and functional.  for UI design, people perfer using Java or Javascript as well.  However, everything has both side.   Javascript has significantly in web-designing but for some PC games, most works have to be done by others language.
