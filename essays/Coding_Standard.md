## The Importance And Benifits of Coding Standard.
Coding standard is the high quality way to type code and the format is properly adopted. Also, it definitely is helpful when people learn programming languages.  However, how coding standard is important to a programmer?  The answer is it is extremely significant to a good programmer.  Different people have different ways to do one thing, so once people are working in a team work, that is not going to work if they work as their specific style.  Therefore, coding standard works this situation since people all code in same way, which people can easily to read others' works.  For example, I once read my classmate's work and actually I could not understand at all.  The reason is that he put two statements in one line and close curly braces in line with statements.  As a beginner of a programmer, coding standard is also help me learn programming languages.  In javascript, I always forget to return value in a function so that cause error of output.  After I learn know the coding standards so I would never have this issue.  Debug is the most important part in coding so coding standard is required when debugging.  When I debug my program, I look every line and try to figure out what the problem. If I programmed on my own way, debugging might be tough when I look back to my code.  

## Impression of Using ESLint with IntelliJ.
I have learned IntelliJ for a week and the ESLint was impressed me because it would tell me any problem even it was not affact compiling.  ESLint is so useful that it makes my code organized and formatted.  Every single yellow mark that I have to correct keeps my program running correctly and perfectly.  Meanwhile, once I get used to checking my code format and developing this habit, I believe I will not have any problem in my future of coding.  Indeed, ESLint gave me a hardet time on my first week of coding and wasted a lot of time to fix up.  However, I now get throught the hardest time and barely have error marks in my programs.  Unconsciously, I have a good habit of typing code and develop my knowledge of programming languages.
