## First Impression

I used to have a dream of being a software engineer when I was young.  Very first time I knew software was 12 years old that I owned first computer in my house.  Everything that was new to me seemed so magical.  I still remember it was Windows 1995 system and desktop had IE browser which was simple and clean desktop.  The first game on my PC was minesweeper that was simply easy game.  After I saw all how computer software did impressive thing, I decided to be a software engineer and create what I wanted.
