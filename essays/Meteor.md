## Meteor
Meteor,originally a small body of matter from outer space that enters the earthâ€™s atmosphere, becoming incandescent as a result of friction and appearing as a streak of light, is also shining in different way on building websites with Javascript.  This is the first time I experienced Meteor with Intelli J to build websites, but I think Meteor is amazing that builds websites funtional with Javascript which is a easy understandable languague.  The first time I started Meteor is a little depressed me because I got a lot of problems in my code and web could not be built.  Even I followed step bt step with professor, I just could not figure out what was wrong.  For example, the "event" template contains event that when user click buttons submit or delete, it happens with information add or delete. However, I did not understand how it worked at that time and what these codes stood for.  Now, I gradually find a way to learn Meteor and understand every statement.  If you do not know it, you will never know how it is really interesting and attractive.  Meteor is that when I play more with it, I feel more its attraction and fun.  For instance, the thing I had never known is how to jump home page when I submitted, but Meteor has a import which is flowrouter,"import { FlowRouter } from 'meteor/kadira:flow-router';", that solves my problem.  

Meteor is not simple as it looks like.  The first impression that Meteor gave to me was easy because I did not deeply develop it instead of copying code from professor. As an application architecture, Meteor is maintainable that divide client and server, which is easy to access code when debugging.  

Overall, Meteor helps me a lot of understanding of building websites.  I am getting more and more comfortable with Meteor and developing my final project.
