## Javascript Reflection

Unlike C language or C++ language, Javascript does not have complicated pointers work needed which is much easier to be understood and accepted. Also, Javascript which relates to website designing is the majority choice for website designers.  I have experienced C, C++ and Java for two years so as my perspectives Javascript is more dynamic and functional.  for UI design, people perfer using Java or Javascript as well.  However, everything has both side.   Javascript has significantly in web-designing but for some PC games, most works have to be done by others languages.  Being software engineering, developing applications is the priority. Therefore, software engineers may not satisfy Javascript but concentrate on other languages. 

### WOD
WODs which is easiest to handle is the most helpful I have ever used.  you just open the website and no need to type whole thing just function and call it, then build successfully and answers pop up.  Since I used WODs, I have fell in love with it.  Comparing C language which I am studying, WODs just need easy operation and simple code and then give me the answers which I want. Like this picture, simply type a function which is no need main function and something else and it works.

Right now, I am so enjoyable of practicing with WODs.  It frees me without complicate structures and let me have more time to work on logical problems.  I have seen improvement of my coding speed and correctness.  WODs truely works me and develops my sense of coding now and future.
