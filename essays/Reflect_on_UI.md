##Semantic UI
With building UI framework, there are prenty of softwares that work well on UI.  Why we choose to use Semantic UI but not others?  Semantic UI, as literal meaning is like language grammer, has a certain rule which is easy to be read for people and undertood.  Since UI framework is quite a complicated, people realized they might program other sofaware to make it become easier so users have better experience of building UI and make good efforts.  Therefore, many softwares come out with their distinct features and benefits.  Semantic UI has most natural language of useful principles which defines classes with a few words and has different outcomes.  For examples, when I want a grid, I can just says "class="ui grid" " and it gives me a grid.  Moreover, if I want a three column grid, I just need to define the class and get different column grid.  A extraordinary natural language makes me coding effectively.  However, it really frustrated me at the beginning.  As a person is new to UI, Semantic UI was surprising me that how it worked with websites.  After I watched all the videos about Semantic UI, I had a basic acquaintance of it.  Since these days of practice of Semantic UI, I have gained fundamental UI buildings and a certain capability of building a beautiful website with different elements.  

Meanwhile, benefits of UI framework for software engeering are not ignorable.  As a software engeer, sometimes we also have to deal with interface of software, such as login interface, interactions with users and software frames.  In order to developing a better skill of software development, the necessary UI frameworks is indeed to be done and mastered for a software engeer. 

I personally think Semantic UI is easy to learn.  Easy readable and understandable features make a great effort on me.  As a new UI framework, Semantic UI does a great job that provides organized documentation and reliable features, which people are more like to accept and use it.  I have never used another framework so I have nothing to compare with Semantic UI.  Based on what I know boostrap and fondation, I think Semantic UI is the best for a beginner.  Semantic UI may not be so professional right now but it is the best option for me.
