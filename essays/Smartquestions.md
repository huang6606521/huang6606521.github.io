##What is smart questions?
Most people ask what is smart questions? What questions are smart or what questions are not smart?  Usually, people ask questions that is hard to understand by readers so it causes readers have no idea to respond and people also will not get the answers which they expect.  Therefore, a smart question should declear what you want to know at the first sentence clearly and use "object-deviation",which starts with object that what is problem with and deviation to explain how, describs what you want to ask(Eric Raymond).  Moreover, more details should be added if there is more specific problems so readers can quickly define problems.  However, not smart questions always confuse readers with purposes of questions. 

##Why smart questions are important for smart software engeers?
Software engeer, who should have logic,organization and creativeness, standing the top of technology, does the most complicated jobs in the world.  consequently, a good software engeer should be smart and not ask stupid questions.  First of all, smart questions have better logical sentence's structure that makes reader understand fastly.  It trains software engeers to be logic on asking questions as well as constructing programs.  Second, smart questions are always organized so whenever before you ask questions, you have to organize the sentences and make sure that is clear enough.  Thus, smart questions let you have organized mind which is significant to you.  Third, smart engeers should be with creativeness and in consequent they are able to create incredible things.  Therefore, smart questions is not only asking questions wisely, but also develops smart software engeers.

##Experience I earn from smart questions.
I used to ask questions on websites but barely got answers which mostly were what I expected.  I realized that it was because the way I asked was not appropriate.  Most questions were not clear so the answers could not solve my problems.  After I knew how to come up with smart questions, I got more accurate answers and problems also got solved.  Meanwhile, I improved my insights of programming and logic.
