## Configuration Management
The very first quesiton is what is configuration management? This question gets me because I did not notice this word before.  Therefore, I looked up in dictionary and it gave me the definition, "Configuration management (CM) is the detailed recording and updating of information that describes an enterprise's hardware and software. Such information typically includes the versions and updates that have been applied to installed software packages and the locations and network addresses of hardware devices"(Margaret Rouse).  As how I understand this definition, configuration management is managing a software with updating it in order to keep imformation accurate and contemporary.  Also, configuration management has benefits of managing source code, sharing code, remoting save and read code.  

## My Experience of Configuration Management
For me, experience of configuration management, I am not sure if I have any experience.  I am using some social softwares like Facebook and Line but I have no authority to manage them about version updating or debugging.  Now, however, Github is the first one I can code it and make the surface as I like.  I believe Github is popluar because of git which users can develop their software and control their tasks as well.  Besides Github, Google, facebook, Microsoft etc. are all using git open source. I am a beginner of using Github and I did not use any one simliar with it.  And I feel comfortable with practicing it, especially when I type code to change the frame.  After some days, I will master the Github and get more knowledge of configuration management.
